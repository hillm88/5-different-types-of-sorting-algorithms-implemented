# 5-different-types-of-sorting-algorithms-implemented

I implemented selection sort, bubble sort, merge sort, quick sort and insertion sort. To use the code, edit the array titled "array" and insert the numbers you wish to use, or change the selectrandomarraylength variable if you wish to have a random array of a desired length. The output you will get is a sorted set of numbers along with the time it took in milliseconds. The whole purpose of this code is to compare the amount of time it takes in milliseconds to run each sorting algorithm.
